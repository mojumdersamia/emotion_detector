# 🧠 Emotion Detection from Text

## 📖 Overview
**Emotion Detection from Text** is a Python project that leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify and detect the emotional tone present in a given sentence or paragraph.  
The system uses a pre-trained transformer-based model to analyze textual input and outputs both the predicted emotion and confidence scores.

---

## ✨ Features

- Detects common emotions such as: **anger, joy, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust, and neutral**
- Utilizes a robust **state-of-the-art model** from Hugging Face's Transformers library
- Simple **command-line interface** for ease of use

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.7 or above
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### 📦 Python Dependencies

- `torch`
- `transformers`

---

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the repository** or copy the source files to your working directory.

2. **(Recommended) Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv emo-env
emo-env\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
# Or, on macOS/Linux:
# source emo-env/bin/activate
Install required packages

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install torch transformers
🚀 Usage
Run the main script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python detect_emotion.py
Input your text when prompted.

🧪 Example
yaml
Copy
Edit
Enter text: I am so excited for the concert!
Detected Emotion: joy (Confidence: 0.94)
All predictions:
- joy : 0.94
- surprise : 0.02
- neutral : 0.02
- others...
🧩 Code Example
python
Copy

from transformers import pipeline

def detect_emotion(text):
    classifier = pipeline('text-classification', 
                          model='j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base',
                          return_all_scores=True)
    results = classifier(text)[0]
    results = sorted(results, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)
    top = results[0]
    print(f"Detected Emotion: {top['label']} (Confidence: {top['score']:.2f})")
    print("All predictions:")
    for item in results:
        print(f"- {item['label']} : {item['score']:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    text = input("Enter text: ")
    detect_emotion(text)
📝 Notes
Ensure your Python interpreter is using the correct virtual environment, especially when using an IDE like VS Code.

The model may require an internet connection on the first run (downloads from huggingface.co).

If you face issues with installing dependencies, see the Troubleshooting section.

🛠 Troubleshooting
❌ ModuleNotFoundError:
✅ Ensure your virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed.

❌ Permission Errors:
✅ Try running your terminal or command prompt as an administrator.

❌ Model Loading Issues:
✅ Check your internet connection and verify that both torch and transformers are installed properly.
