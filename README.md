# 🧠 Emotion Detection from Text

## 📖 Overview
**Emotion Detection from Text** is a Python project that leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify and detect the emotional tone present in a given sentence or paragraph.  
The system uses a pre-trained transformer-based model to analyze textual input and outputs both the predicted emotion and confidence scores.
